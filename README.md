# DAO-JDBC

Repository testing DAO, Factory and Singleton design pattern.

### Important to notice:
- To use this code, MySQL service needs to be running
- It's necessary to have a db.properties file with the data of the SQL server, for exemple:

```
user=<username>
password=<password>
dburl=<url_to_server>
useSSL=false
```
